# Creating a grid-based CSS framework

This project focuses on building a grid-based CSS framework like bootstrap, foundation semtantic UI - to name just a few.

We used CSS Grid and Flex as the basic building block for the grid system. We maintained the conventional 12-grid style and included come commonly used components and utilities. You can find out more by checking out the [documentation](./docs.md).
